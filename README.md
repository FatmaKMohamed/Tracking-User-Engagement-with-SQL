# Tracking-User-Engagement-with-SQL
This project is part of the 365 Data Science Platform's "Tracking User Engagement with SQL" case study. The goal is to analyze user engagement trends on the platform, specifically examining the impact of new features introduced at the end of 2021.

## Project Overview
The analysis evaluates whether the release of new courses, exams, and career tracks resulted in increased student engagement during the first half of 2022.
